Revision history for perl module Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ

0.009000 - 2015-01-14
    - Added support for specifying an optional timeout for `recv()`.

0.008000 - 2015-01-13
    - Added the `redelivered` key to the message hashref returned by the `recv()` method (Dave Rolsky)
    - Added a `cancel()` method to cancel an existing consumer tag, as provided to or returned by the `consume()` method. (Dave Rolsky)

0.007001 - 2014-11-09
	- Added timestamp types to the supported types, they are converted to unsigned 64-bit integers.
	- Added the `manual_tests` directory for some manual testing I did for development.
	- Added some documentation about headers to the `get()` method.

0.007000 - 2014-11-03
    - Major re-factoring done to how Perl-to-C type inferences are done
    - Most AMQP header data types from AMQP into Perl should be supported.
    - Upgraded the librabbitmq-c version to the latest stable v0.5.2
    - Nested headers are now working

0.006002 - 2014-09-19
    - Add MANIFEST to dist

0.006001 - 2014-09-19
    - Doc fixes (autarch)

0.006000 - 2014-09-19
    - Fixed assigning an uint64_t to an int32_t value #12 (manchicken)
    - Fixed hashes and arrays aren't properly handled when sent in as headers #18 (manchicken)

0.005007 - 2014-07-03
    - Fixed a reported memory leak
    - Fixed a problem with failed assertions on channel_close() on a not-at-all-connected instance.

0.005006 - 2014-06-24
    - Added some additional handling for UTF-8 going into Perl strings (manchicken)
    - Added a simple test to demonstrate UTF-8 safety. (manchicken)

0.005005 - 2014-06-17
    - Changed timeout test to use seconds rather than sub seconds, as it was failing on bsds

0.005004 - 2014-06-12
    - Updated POD to include the new is_connected() method.
    - Added socket error detection and disconnection logic into the die_on_* methods, and updated calls to those functions accordingly.

0.005003 - 2014-06-10
    - Fixed an issue where the disconnect from the server was causing the publish() to fail without resetting file descriptor... which made it impossible to detect connection issues encountered during publish. Also updated the recv() to handle the socket error status as well. (manchicken)

0.005002 - 2014-06-07
    - Fixed an issue where a disconnect from the server may have occurred during an internal_recv() call, but we weren't detecting and disconnecting accordingly. Now we disconnect in a way that allows is_connected() to realize that we're no longer connected so that we can then re-connect (manchicken)

0.005001 - 2014-06-07
    - changed tests to use unique queue/exchange names

0.005000 - 2014-06-07
    - removed no_wait from purge documentation as it doesn't do anything
    - Added queue_delete method

0.004002 - 2014-04-02
    - Added Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ::is_connected() to determine whether or not you have a live connection. (manchicken)
    - Added a call to Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ::disconnect() to close the socket connection as well. (manchicken)
    - Added a test to verify the is_connected() functionality. (manchicken)

0.004001 - 2014-02-22
    - changed github repo url

0.004000 - 2014-01-12
    - fixed a memory leak when using transactions

0.003001 - 2014-01-12
    - updated Makefile.PL to fix a compile issue on Debian Wheezy

    - removed basic_return method, since standard version of librabbitmq is used, not custom fork
    - Changes file changed to suppot CPAN::Changes
    - client send a heartbeat back whenever it receives one.
