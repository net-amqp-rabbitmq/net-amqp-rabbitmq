0.005005 - 2014-06-17

0.005004 - 2014-06-12
    - Updated POD to include the new is_connected() method.
    - Added socket error detection and disconnection logic into the die_on_* methods, and updated calls to those functions accordingly.

0.005003 - 2014-06-10
    - Fixed an issue where the disconnect from the server was causing the publish() to fail without resetting file descriptor... which made it impossible to detect connection issues encountered during publish. Also updated the recv() to handle the socket error status as well. (manchicken)

0.005002 - 2014-06-07
    - Fixed an issue where a disconnect from the server may have occurred during an internal_recv() call, but we weren't detecting and disconnecting accordingly.
